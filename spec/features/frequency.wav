Feature: Assigning a frequency to a sonification

As a user
I want to define the frequency of a tone
So that I can hear that frequency

  Scenario
    Given a frequency of 440 Hz
    When I create a file called "freq.wav"
    Then I extract the frequency from the "freq.wav"
    And I see a graph called "singletone.png"

  Scenario
    Given an series of frequencies in an arpeggio
    When I create a file called "arpeggio.wav"
    Then I extract the frequencies from the "arpeggio.wav"
    And I see a graph called "arpeggio.png"
